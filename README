=== Extensions to the Ruby's Matrix

Also included are Matrix extensions by Cosmin Bonchis, which was done
as a Google Summer of Code 2007 project for Ruby Central Inc.

The library consists of some enhancements to the Ruby "Matrix" module
and includes: LU and QR (Householder, Givens, Gram Schmidt, Hessenberg)
decompositions, bidiagonalization, eigenvalue and eigenvector calculations.

This library is contatined in stick/matrix.rb, which also draws upon
stick/mapcar.rb.

This code can also be found on RubyForge at:
