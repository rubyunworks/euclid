= Euclid

== DESCRIPTION

Euclidis a set of extensions and additions to Ruby's math facilities.


== SYNOPSIS

=== Math Functions

Euclid include a set of modules that extend Math.

=== Matrix and Vector

Euclid includss Matrix and Vecotr extensions by Cosmin Bonchis,
which were done for the Google Summer of Code 2007 project for
Ruby Central Inc.

Unfortunately there were issues with extending Ruby's built-in classes
so Euclid provides compatible substitutes.

The library includes LU and QR (Householder, Givens, Gram Schmidt, Hessenberg)
decompositions, bidiagonalization, eigenvalue and eigenvector calculations.

This code can also be found on RubyForge at: http://rubyforge.org/project/matrix

=== Interval

Euclid provides a true Interval class, which is very similar to the Range
class, but provides front sentinal inclusion and exclusion.

=== Infinity

Euclid also provides an Infinity class which gracefully handles the normal
numeric operations. It also supports aleph degress of infinity (though
not 100% as of yet.)


== ADOPTION
